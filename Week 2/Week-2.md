<h3>This week I learnt TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)</h3>
(The TF-IDF is the product of the term frequency and the inverse document frequency.)<br><br>


<ol>
<li>In information retrieval and text mining, there are certain words which don’t contain useful information. These words can lead to bad performance 
during training and test time. <br>
- Implement the statistical technique - TF-IDF, to downweight the class of words in the feature vector representation. </li>
<li>Apply scikit-learn’s TfidfTransformer to convert sample text into a vector of tf-idf values and apply the L2-normalization to it.</li>
<li>Clean and pre-process text data</li>
<li>Strip the data set of reviews of irrelevant characters including HTML tags, punctuation, and emojis using regular expressions.</li>
</ol>
