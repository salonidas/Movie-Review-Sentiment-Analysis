<h3>This week I learnt Tokenization of Documents</h3>

<ol>
<li>Create a function for tokenizer, which takes in a string and returns an array of words contained in the sentence.</li>
<li>Create a function for stemming, which takes in the array of words from tokenizer and shortens each word by removing the end.</li>
<li>Remove all the stopwords from the string i.e a, an, the, and, etc. </li>
</ol>
